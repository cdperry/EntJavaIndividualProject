## Week 1

01/20/2016

Tasks Completed:

- Got caught up on week 1 readings
- Set up my environment (IntelliJ, Git, OpenShift, MySQL, TomEE+)
- Performed week 1 activities in-class to further familiarize myself with Git and IntelliJ
- Started noodling on an idea for a project

I'm thinking about creating a Java app that will let me store and retrieve information about home brewing (receipes, equipment setup, common calculations, etc.)  At this point I'm still trying to figure out how a web service could be integrated into a project such as this.


## Week 2

01/27/2016

Tasks Completed:

- Got caught up on week 2 readings
- Completed week 2 exercises.  Found 'SantaInAnElevator' to be interesting, had a hard time with the Unit Testing exercises.  Thinking of
negative tests was a bit difficult.
- Solidified project idea and came up with paper mock-ups for the user interface.


## Week 3

02/03/2016

Tasks Completed: 

- Got caught up on week 3 readings
- Completed the SQL DAO and Hibernate DAO exercises
- Haven't started my project yet.  Definitely finding that this course is much more time-intensive than the previous two courses in the certificate program.
- Need to start moving on the project - at this point finding time to work on the readings, the exercises and the project is running counter to the fact that I'm leaving my current job and starting a new one (finishing up major projects and trying to get things in order before I leave)  Hoping the noise settles after 2/22 when I start the new gig.


## Week 4

02/10/2016

- Started researching a UI HTML/CSS template for my project
- Started looking at Bootstrap

## Week 5

02/17/2016

- Completed readings and exercises
- Started building a template .JSP page for my project which involved deconstructing a bootstrap template into its constituent components, removing the pieces I didn't need and testing to make sure that the page display displayed properly.
- Wasn't able to focus too much on the course as I was completing an SAP BusinessObjects upgrade for my employer.  Ended up spending the entire weekend performing the upgrade and dealing with issues stemming from the upgrade.  So much for testing ...

## Week 6

02/24/2016
- Completed readings
- Started a new job with the Department of Children and Families (State of Wisconsin)
- Wasn't able to attend class on 2/24 due to a late-running meeting at the new job
- Completed exercises and caught up on in-class materials over the weekend

## Week 7
