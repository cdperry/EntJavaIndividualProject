## Week 1

01/20/2016

Tasks Completed:

- Got caught up on week 1 readings
- Set up my environment (IntelliJ, Git, OpenShift, MySQL, TomEE+)
- Performed week 1 activities in-class to further familiarize myself with Git and IntelliJ
- Started noodling on an idea for a project

I'm thinking about creating a Java app that will let me store and retrieve information about home brewing (receipes, equipment setup, common calculations, etc.)  At this point I'm still trying to figure out how a web service could be integrated into a project such as this.


## Week 2

01/27/2016

Tasks Completed:

- Got caught up on week 2 readings
- Completed week 2 exercises.  Found 'SantaInAnElevator' to be interesting, had a hard time with the Unit Testing exercises.  Thinking of
negative tests was a bit difficult.
- Solidified project idea and came up with paper mock-ups for the user interface.


## Week 3

02/03/2016

Tasks Completed: 

- Got caught up on week 3 readings
- Completed the SQL DAO and Hibernate DAO exercises
- Haven't started my project yet.  Definitely finding that this course is much more time-intensive than the previous two courses in the certificate program.
- Need to start moving on the project - at this point finding time to work on the readings, the exercises and the project is running counter to the fact that I'm leaving my current job and starting a new one (finishing up major projects and trying to get things in order before I leave)  Hoping the noise settles after 2/22 when I start the new gig.


## Week 4

02/10/2016

- Started researching a UI HTML/CSS template for my project
- Started looking at Bootstrap
