## Week 1

01/20/2016

Tasks Completed:

- Got caught up on week 1 readings
- Set up my environment (IntelliJ, Git, OpenShift, MySQL, TomEE+)
- Performed week 1 activities in-class to further familiarize myself with Git and IntelliJ
- Started noodling on an idea for a project

I'm thinking about creating a Java app that will let me store and retrieve information about home brewing (receipes, equipment setup, common calculations, etc.)  At this point I'm still trying to figure out how a web service could be integrated into a project such as this.
