# Chris Perry's Individual Project

This repository will hold the content for my Spring 2016 Enteprise Java individual project

## Problem Statement

At this point the problem is that I don't have a project idea yet.  I'm thinking about maybe trying to build a web application that will assist with home brewing.  It could help store, retrieve and modify recipes.  It could also contain equipment profiles (kettles, fermenters, etc) and maybe provide tools for common brewing calculations.

The project needs to include a web service but at this point I'm not sure what I'd integrate.  Maybe something not terribly exciting like getting weather information for the brew day so I can adjust whether or not I could brew outdoors or indoors?

Maybe I can use this somehow?

Possible ideas for team project integration?
