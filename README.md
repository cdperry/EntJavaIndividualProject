## Problem Statement

Home brewers face a common issue.  They're inspired to create a recipe which might originate on a notepad or the back of a bar napkin.  The recipe is then created over a weekend and some notes are scribbled on some scrap paper in the garage.  This project will involve building a web application that will assist with home brewing.  It will help store, retrieve and modify recipes.  It will also contain equipment profiles (kettles, fermenters, etc) and will provide tools for common brewing calculations.

As far as web service integration goes I plan ot utilize existing brewing ingredient databases that are made accessible from the web.  

Potential web services include: 
- [openbeer.db](http://openbeer.github.io)
- [brewerydb.com](http://www.brewerydb.com)

Possible ideas for team project integration?
- TBD
